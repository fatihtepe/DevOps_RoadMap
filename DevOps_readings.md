[Discovering AWS](https://adayinthelifeof.nl/2020/05/20/aws.html)

You might realise that it’s probably near impossible to dive into
each service and completely understand how they work and most likely,
you don’t really need to know the exact ins and outs. But, having a basic
understanding on each service can be a major benefit as a developer, architect
or administrator. It makes it easier to see if there is an already existing solution
for your problem at hand.

So, I dove into each and every service to figure out what it
exactly was for and how it works in the basics. I tried to
experiment with as many components as possible (time and
money permitting, I didn’t want to spend 15.000$ on
AWS Data Exchange). I tried to capture what the
service does in a single one-liner to give
you a global overview.

I think most of them are correct enough but if you have any suggestions
or corrections, please tell me!

[How To: Become Invisible on the Web Using Linux](https://medium.com/upskilling/how-to-become-invisible-on-the-web-using-linux-dc86ef12ab51)

‘Tails’ is a Debian based Linux distribution renowned by Edward Snowden for is privacy capabilities. With a simple design, it is very easy to use by anyone and offers a host of security features preinstalled to make your online experience totally anonymous. Note that Tails is 100% dedicated to online privacy, and is not a suitable for gaming, media production, office work, or casual use. The best way to get the most out of Tails is by downloading it onto a ‘bootable’ USB key and plugging it into any public or private computer to instantly become invisible wherever you go.
The main safeguard put in place by this distro is the TOR network. TOR hides your IP address by randomly running your data through a series of TOR nodes before hitting the main server. That way, if the server company wants to see your IP all they will see is the last node that the TOR ran through (which is some random IP not connected to you). Also, all of your data sent through TOR is encrypted, so anyone listening in on your data stream will only see gibberish.

DevOps is really hot at the moment and most of my friends, colleagues, and senior developers I know are working hard to become a DevOps engineer and project themselves as DevOps champion in their organization.
While I truly acknowledge the benefits of DevOps, which is directly linked to improved software development and deployment, from my limited experience I can say that it’s not an easy job. It’s very difficult to choose the right path in the middle of so many tools and practices.
Being a Java blogger, many of my readers often ask me questions like how to become a DevOps engineer, which tools should I learn? which practices should I follow? does learning Maven and Jenkins must for a DevOps guy? how about Docker and Kubernetes? Does the infrastructure automation part of DevOps? should I learn Chef, Puppet, or Ansible are just some of those questions which keep coming to me.

[What is GitOps?](https://www.gitops.tech/)


GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications. It focuses on a developer-centric experience when operating infrastructure, by using tools developers are already familiar with, including Git and Continuous Deployment tools.

The core idea of GitOps is having a Git repository that always contains declarative descriptions of the infrastructure currently desired in the production environment and an automated process to make the production environment match the described state in the repository. If you want to deploy a new application or update an existing one, you only need to update the repository - the automated process handles everything else. It’s like having cruise control for managing your applications in production.
